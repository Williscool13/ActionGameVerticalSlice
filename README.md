# ActionGameVerticalSlice
My Sandbox for my (never going to be truly finished) third person action shooter

This project is a sandbox for me to learn, test, and create the multiple technical solutions provided by Unity.
At the moment, this includes:
- DOTS/ECS
- Shaders (Shader Graph)
- VFX (VFX Graph)
- Light/Reflection Probes
- Multiplayer (Fusion 2.0)
- Addressables
- Animation Rigging (Procedural Animations)
